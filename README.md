## üî• About This Fork

This is a **forked and customized version** of the original terminal portfolio template created by [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing/terminal-portfolio). 

**Why this fork exists:**
- The original project has not been receiving regular updates
- I (Vihaan) am currently learning fullstack development and wanted to practice with this template
- This fork serves as both a learning exercise and a maintained version for others to use
- Feel free to use this template for your own portfolio projects!

**Original Creator:** [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev) - Full credit goes to the original developer for creating this amazing terminal portfolio concept.
